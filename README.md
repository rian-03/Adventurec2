# adventurec2
 Adventurec is a text adventure game programmed in C

 - the biggest change in ac2 is that spaces are much freer than in adventurec, being determined by xyz coordinates and a boolean that allows for two rooms in one xyz position
 - another addition is magical spells, although I only ever got one in there, I'll let you figure out how to do it
 - I also intended to make a working bow and arrow mechanic, but I believe it is broken

### Currently I am working on ac3, in wich I rebuild the concept of ac2 with my first semester university brain.
-
   - Big changes like dinamic memory, a .h file with a src/ directory and many more will come.
   - I'm also changing the boolean of spaces into a full byte that allows for many more 'rooms' in one space
   - The more noticeable change though will be that creatures around the world will now have things they say, trades, etc, basically it's more than just monsters and traders
   - I'll also set up a more interesting world in the 'default game' so you'll be able to see what can be done with this
